The core ab+c team is two people, [Anthony Kolber](http://aestheticallyloyal.com) & [Ben Schwarz](http://germanforblack.com).
We’ve been working together for the past decade or so building things for the web. By definition, Anthony works as
a graphic designer and Ben as a developer, but we leverage the crossover of these two skill sets to create interesting
technology solutions.

For the last seven or eight years, we’ve focused on building web-based applications. We’ve helped small companies, large companies,
vc-funded companies, self-funded companies, friend’s companies and even worked on a few applications for ourselves.
So, it’s what we do. We believe in the power and focus of small teams, agile development practices and clean, intelligent
design. The products we build are things that we want to use and we help our clients build to that same ideology. Over the years, we’ve developed
strong philosophies on product design and development and we consult with companies helping refine their own ideas and processes.

We believe in the power of collective knowledge, which is why we’re documenting our thoughts and philosophies here. In the hope
it will in some way benefit the development of the greater web.
