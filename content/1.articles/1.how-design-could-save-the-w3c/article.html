    <p>While preparing my <a href="http://workshop.germanforblack.com/">HTML workshop</a>, I’ve been re-reading W3C
      specs in far further detail than I ever would’ve imagined. The reading experience is far from delightful. Not
      only is the text the entire browser width in measure, but it’s dense and laborious to read. No wonder browser
      vendors have traditionally missed subtle details.</p>

    <p>The goal was to add some sane styles to the pre-existing spec pages that would vastly improve the reading
      experience.</p>

    <p>I whipped up a quick bookmarklet to load some custom CSS. I was already happy. I wrote to Anthony; a typical
      kind of email that we would trade:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>From: Ben Schwarz<br>
        To: Anthony Kolber</p>

      <p>So, I’ve been trying to read specs more than ever.<br>
        Not only is the language used some form of incomprehensible bullshit, but the readability of these pages is
        absysmal.</p>

      <p>I’ve been considering this for a few months now.</p>

      <p>Why does a page have to look like (see screen shot attachment) that ugly ass bullshit?<br>
        I think the pages could easily hide some useless information and present a little easier to read.</p>

      <p>What do you think? Interested at applying some typography to the specs with me? I’m planning on writing an
        article about it and sending it to the WHATWG and W3C mailing lists...</p>

    <p>I promptly pushed my progress to github and added Anthony as a contributor.</p>

    <p>Having attempted to read through some of the specs, I had to agree. They are by nature very dense documents, made
      all the worse by a lack of proper typographic consideration. Neither of us was in a position to rewrite the specs,
      but improving their readability was a good starting point.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<dl class="ben">
  <dt>Ben/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>I wanted the titles to be large and image-like. No spidery, thin text; it needed to cement the content that followed.
      I chose Chunk from The league of Movable Type and used <code>@font-face</code>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="anthony">
  <dt>Anthony/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The body typeface specified by the W3C is <code>font-family: sans-serif</code>, which ends up as Arial on Windows and
      Helvetica on Mac OS. Not a terrible choice, but while these typefaces give a clean, structured feel to the page, they
      are less ideal for reading large blocks of text. We switched out <code>sans-serif</code> in favour of
      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=4">Matthew Carter’s Georgia</a>, which has a larger
      x-height and is properly hinted, which makes it better suited to extended on-screen reading.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="ben">

  <dd>
    <p>When a typographer refers to ‘the measure’, they mean the width of the text body. Simply put, when copy is too wide
      or poorly spaced it becomes difficult to read. This was the first issue that I had; physically scanning back and forth
      over the text was annoying and frustrating.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="anthony">
  <dt>Anthony/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The general rule for a comfortable measure is around 60–70 characters per line. On the web, each character averages
      out to around 0.5em in width, so setting a measure of 33em should keep each line within the optimum range.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Poorly defined hierarchy</h3>

<dl class="ben">
  <dt>Ben/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Why do I want to know about this version, the previous version, editors and previous editors before I’d read any
      of the spec or its introduction? Perhaps this is useful internally, but for the rest of us, its just visual noise
      that could be removed.</p>

      <p>Additionally, a spec is hard to scan, but it’s even harder to decipher the different levels of hierarchy. We
        decided to make a visual feature and pull the numbering out to the left, creating a column that overhung the main
        text.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="anthony">
  <dt>Anthony/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We added an additional colour palette based off <code>#066</code> to help clarify the multiple levels of headings.
      Colour variation is much easier for the eye to differentiate than the hierarchical number system the W3C employs.
      <code>#066</code> blends nicely with the black body text — letting us emphasise links without interrupting the reading
      flow. It also gives a nice tonal range to work with, all the way down to <code>#cff</code> which works well as a
      background tint behind black (which we used for the main code blocks).</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Putting it together</h3>

<dl class="ben">
  <dt>Ben/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Next up, a <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/76281">userscript version</a> was in order.</p>
    <p>The script is really simple; it just adds the styles and script tags into spec pages. The external script and style
      files are currently hosted straight out of the Github repository.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="anthony">
  <dt>Anthony/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We have spent a bit of time writing override rules to clean up the W3C’s table and list styles and to reduce some of
      the more unwieldy page sections. Due to the complexity and variety of spec pages, it’s an ongoing project. The styles
      will continue to be updated as we come across more awkward type treatments throughout the specs.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl class="ben">
  <dt>Ben/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We haven’t styled every single element that we’ve come across, so if you find something that looks out of place and
      feel like getting your hands dirty, please <a href="http://github.com/benschwarz/w3c-spec-styles">fork the project</a>
      and send me a patch.</p>

    <p>What would we like to see happen with this alternate stylesheet? W3C adoption. Until the W3C start respecting the
      quality of standards that govern the web, we will continue to live in an environment that has a poor understanding
      of its medium. Now, with WHATWG, communication and transparency and a ‘do-over’ in HTML5, we can change the face of
      the future of the web. Now that’s a project worth working on.</p>
