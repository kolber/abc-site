    <p>Over the past few years our work together as ab+c has progressively grown from a side project to the point where most of the work we do is under the ab+c banner. It became clear that our one-page website was no longer going to cut it, so we started throwing around some ideas.</p>

    <p>The starting point was an article we co-wrote about our W3C restyle project on <a href="http://germanforblack.com" rel="external">Ben’s blog</a> (for posterity we’ve <a href="@root_path/articles/how-design-could-save-the-w3c/">republished it here</a>). Having the two authors, we were interested in making both voices evident to the reader.</p>

    <p>Extending our regular working process to a single article on my blog instantly seemed to work. We iterated over a couple of weeks in between commercial reality—like always, we ended each session with a series of detailed comments about tone, voice or delivery then wrapped it up with a phone call. We were never in the same place when we worked on it.</p>

    <p>There was something about that style of writing that just felt <em>right</em>. In our work together we don’t buy into the idea of a unified voice, we each bring our own ideas and perspectives to projects and feel strongly enough to argue about them. Our intention for this site is to expose some of these exchanges, as this is always where our most interesting ideas come from.</p>

<h3>Design & Build</h3>

<p>As far as the design, I’ve kept it pretty straightforward. Its purpose is to present our texts honestly, without getting in the reader’s way. I applied the <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/occamraz.html">Occam’s Razor</a> principle, removing elements until all that was left was the raw typography. We are then each represented throughout the site by a unique typeface, chosen to reflect the typographic styles of our personal sites. I’ve also been playing around with METAFONT recently, so it was a nice opportunity to use a variant of Donald Knuth’s <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/computer-modern.html" rel="external">Computer Modern</a>.</p>

<p>Our philosophy is that different grades of browsers should experience our content differently, so the css has been structured accordingly. The grid and typography are optimised for iOS devices through some custom <code>@media</code> queries and we’re using an alternate, simplified stylesheet for Internet Explorer (or <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/" rel="external">Chrome Frame</a> if it’s available).</p>

<p>The use of multiple voices raises the issue of marking up discussions and conversations in html. We’re aware that our decision to use definition lists goes against the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#conversations">current html5 recommendations</a>. The idea of using definition lists is not a new one and comes from the old <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html#h-10.3">html 4.01 specs</a>, where conversations were cited as an example use for dls for <code>dl</code>s. The current W3C recommendation is to mark up the conversations using grammar, which doesn’t fit our requirements.</p>
<p>To have these interchanges make sense once they’re marked up, we need a wrapping element that can contain both the authors name and nested markup within the wrapper for the associated text.</p>
-->

<p>Behind the scenes we’re running the site on <a href="http://staceyapp.com">stacey</a> with deployment through a shared, linked dropbox folder. It automatically copies my changes straight across to Ben’s local copy and the server at the same time. We have traditionally used git and <a href="http://www.heroku.com" rel="external">Heroku</a> to manage all of our deployment, so this file-based system makes for an interesting alternative.</p>

  <p>Almost 20 years of joint professional practice proved to us that building your own site is harder than any client job in the world, so as soon as the site could run, we hosted it at a secret url, bouncing comments to each other as we filled the design and content out.</p>
  <p>We're not sure where this site will take us, but we plan to build it over time—serving as documentation to our thoughts and processes as they evolve.</p>
